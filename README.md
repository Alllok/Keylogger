Python Keylogger with pynput



This project is a simple keylogger built using the pynput library in Python. It captures and logs keystrokes, storing them in a text file (keylog.txt). The keylogger runs in the background and stops when the Escape (Esc) key is pressed.

Features :-
 - Logs both character keys and special keys (e.g., space, enter, backspace).
 - Saves logged keystrokes to a file (keylog.txt).
 - Stops logging when the Escape (Esc) key is pressed.
